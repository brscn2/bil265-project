WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net k/sayi_reg[8]_rep__4 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin k/sonuc_isareti_reg_i_2/O, cell k/sonuc_isareti_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
