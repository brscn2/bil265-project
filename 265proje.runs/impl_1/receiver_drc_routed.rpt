2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[0]_i_2__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[0]_i_2__1/O, cell k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[0]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[3]_i_2__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[3]_i_2__1/O, cell k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[3]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net k/sonuc_ondalik2_reg[3]_i_2__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin k/sonuc_ondalik2_reg[3]_i_2__1/O, cell k/sonuc_ondalik2_reg[3]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net s/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin s/sonuc_tam_reg[0]_i_2__0/O, cell s/sonuc_tam_reg[0]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
