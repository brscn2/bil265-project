LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[0]_i_3__1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) k/sonuc_ondalik2_reg[3]/CLR, k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[0]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[3]_i_3__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[1]/CLR, k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[2]/CLR, k/sonuc_ondalik1_reg[3]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
